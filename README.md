# anime-ranker

We are planning on making a small list of top 3 anime's based on 4 production companies 

-- Each production will be displayed on the side
-- when you click production company a larger copy appears center screen with top animes underneath it
-- when you click on anime it displays a description
-- add a button under prod company where you can vote up or down


WERE GOING FOR INTERACTABLE OBJECTS -- NOTHING MAJOR COMPLICATED -- JUST WANT IT TO LOOK COOL PRETTY




**BONUS GOALs:
1. make them move around based on ranking
2. when you click and object it becomes the background but blurry
3. Add images of main characters to anime descriptions
