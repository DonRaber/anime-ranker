# anime-ranker

We are planning on making a small list of top 3 anime's based on 4 production companies 

1. -- Each production will be displayed on the side
2. -- when you click production company a larger copy appears center screen with top animes underneath it
3. -- when you click on anime it displays a description
4. -- a heart on the side that you can click and unclick



WERE GOING FOR INTERACTABLE OBJECTS -- NOTHING MAJOR COMPLICATED -- JUST WANT IT TO LOOK COOL PRETTY




**BONUS GOALs:
1. make them move around based on ranking
2. when you click an object it becomes the background but blurry
3. Add images of main characters to anime descriptions
