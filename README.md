# anime-ranker

We are planning on making a small list of top 3 anime's based on 4 production companies 

1. -- Each production will be displayed on the side
2. -- when you click production company a larger copy appears center screen with top animes underneath it
3. -- when you click on anime it displays a description
4. -- a heart on the side that you can click and unclick



WERE GOING FOR INTERACTABLE OBJECTS -- NOTHING MAJOR COMPLICATED -- JUST WANT IT TO LOOK COOL PRETTY




**BONUS GOALs:
1. make animes under the production move around based on ranking
2. when you click an object it becomes the background but blurry
3. Add images of main characters to anime descriptions
