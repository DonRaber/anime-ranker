# anime-ranker

Capabilities and How to Use:
----------------------------------------------------------

-Gives a list of anime studios and their respective animes

-Click the 'Click Me Senpai' to create the dropdown menu and start the background music(close nav bar to pause music)

-Once a Studio is picked you can hover over an anime to see images of some of the characters, play a short sound clip, and display a short description of the anime(name: both English and Japanese(as well as the pronunciation in Japanese), runtime of the anime, and a short description)

-Clicking of a different studio will clear out the old anime and renders the new anime of the respective studio

- For fun, once all is read and done, you can locate our footer and *maybe* click it to perform a "self-destruct" on the WHOLE HTML and clear the page lol (because why not ðŸ¥´)




We are planning on making a small list of top 3 anime's based on 4 production companies 

1. -- Each production will be displayed on the side
2. -- when you click production company a larger copy appears center screen with top animes underneath it
3. -- when you click on anime it displays a description



WERE GOING FOR INTERACTABLE OBJECTS -- NOTHING MAJOR COMPLICATED -- JUST WANT IT TO LOOK COOL PRETTY




**BONUS GOALs:
1. when you click an Anime Image the description pops up over/around the image with character vectors on screen
2. Add images of main characters to anime descriptions
3. Add Background music
